# TypeScript Webpack Starter Project

*The name says it all!*

This is a super simple, easy peasy lemon squeezy starter project for
TypeScript, using Webpack 3 for development & building and TSLint for
code quality.

## Status

This little project/boilerplate is still in development and I wouldn't
*yet* recommend it for primetime production apps, however the goal for this
project is to make it into a developer's friend for fast development and
provide convenient tooling for optimised, production-ready static assets.

Suggestions and PRs are welcome!

## Commands

`npm start` — Run your local development server

`npm run build` — Compile your app into static, production-ready files

The following commands also support adding `:watch` to the end to start
watching your files and continuously reloading when files change:

`npm run test` — Run tests with coverage output shown

`npm run lint` — Run TSLint on files in the `src` directory

## About

This was created in a couple of spare hours for fun as a primer to
Webpack v3's new features.

This just goes to show that both TypeScript and Webpack have come a
long way (and keept getting better) towards being as developer-friendly
as possible, giving us amazing tooling for little overhead when getting
setup.
